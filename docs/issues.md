# Defects and tasks

Detail for the items in [TODO.md](TODO.md).

## TMR — Hook check interval and scroll clear delay are hardcoded

The hook check interval is 1000 ms in the `Hooks` constructor ([Hooks.cs](../SKeys9/SKeys9/Hooks.cs)). The delay before scroll counters clear is 300 ms in `Input.StartScrollRemoveTimer` ([Input.cs](../SKeys9/SKeys9/Input.cs)). Both should be settings.

**Plan:** for each value, add a static field in `Configuration`, a `case` in `LoadSettings` and a line in `ApplySettings`. Set the timer intervals from these fields. `Hooks` and `Input` are created after `ReadSettings`, so startup already works, but a change made in the settings window must also update the running timers. Open decision: offer controls in `SettingsForm`, or only `skeys9.ini` keys.

**Verify:** set both values in `skeys9.ini` and restart. Scroll counters then linger for the set time. Press OK in the settings window, and both values are still in the file.

**Docs when done:** CLAUDE.md § Architecture (1 s and 300 ms become defaults). Changelog entry for the new settings.

## CNR — Settings Cancel and close do not always revert

`SettingsForm` previews changes by writing straight into the `Configuration` statics. Cancel reverts by calling `Configuration.ReadSettings()`, which returns at once when `skeys9.ini` doesn't exist ([Configuration.cs](../SKeys9/SKeys9/Configuration.cs)). So until the file exists, Cancel keeps the previewed changes. `SettingsForm` also has no `FormClosing` handler, so closing it with the window's X always keeps them. In both cases the changes are unsaved, so the display and the file disagree until the next OK or restart.

**Evidence:** read 2026-10-21.

**Plan:** take a snapshot of the settings when `SettingsForm` opens. Restore it on Cancel and on any close that isn't OK, using a flag that OK sets before it closes the window. To build the snapshot, split `ApplySettings` into a part that serializes to a dictionary and a part that saves the file. `LoadSettings` can then restore from that dictionary.

**Verify:** delete `skeys9.ini`, open the settings window, change a colour and press Cancel: the colour reverts. Do the same and close with X: it reverts. Change a colour and press OK: it is saved.

**Docs when done:** CLAUDE.md § Settings flow. Changelog entry.
